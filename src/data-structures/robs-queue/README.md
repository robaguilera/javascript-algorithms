# Queue

Linear Data Structure aka Sequential Collection
A type of data structure in which the nodes are kept in order by operations which only allow the enqueue of nodes (added to the rear terminal) or dequeue of nodes (removed from the front terminal).
This makes a queue a FIFO (first in first out) data structure. This means that the first element added will be the first element to be removed. This also means to remove an element, all other elements ahead of it must be removed first.

Example:

- JavaScript stack trace
