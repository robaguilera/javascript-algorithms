# Doubly Linked List

A linked collection of nodes in which the order is not by index value but by "links" on each node that point to the **previous** and the **next** node.
Much like the linked list, expect you can traverse forwards and backwards easier.

Pros:

- Easier to traverse as you don't have to keep a reference to the previous node as it's always provided

## Pseudocode for Basic Operations

### Insert

```text
Add(value)
  Pre: value is the value to add to the list
  Post: value has been placed at the tail of the list
  n ← node(value)
  if head = ø
    head ← n
    tail ← n
  else
    n.previous ← tail
    tail.next ← n
    tail ← n
  end if
end Add
```

### Delete

```text
Remove(head, value)
  Pre: head is the head node in the list
       value is the value to remove from the list
  Post: value is removed from the list, true; otherwise false
  if head = ø
    return false
  end if
  if value = head.value
    if head = tail
      head ← ø
      tail ← ø
    else
      head ← head.next
      head.previous ← ø
    end if
    return true
  end if
  n ← head.next
  while n != ø and value !== n.value
    n ← n.next
  end while
  if n = tail
    tail ← tail.previous
    tail.next ← ø
    return true
  else if n != ø
    n.previous.next ← n.next
    n.next.previous ← n.previous
    return true
  end if
  return false
end Remove
```

### Reverse Traversal

```text
ReverseTraversal(tail)
  Pre: tail is the node of the list to traverse
  Post: the list has been traversed in reverse order
  n ← tail
  while n != ø
    yield n.value
    n ← n.previous
  end while
end Reverse Traversal
```

## Complexities

## Time Complexity

| Access | Search | Insertion | Deletion |
| :----: | :----: | :-------: | :------: |
|  O(n)  |  O(n)  |   O(1)    |   O(n)   |

### Space Complexity

O(n)
